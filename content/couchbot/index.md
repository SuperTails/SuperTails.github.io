### Overview

Perhaps Couchbot, a motorized remote-control couch, is not actually the future of transportation.
But that doesn't mean it isn't a blast to drive!

I implemented much of the electrical control board, and also helped write the firmware.

### Features

- Controlled using a standard PlayStation 3 controller
- Top speed of 15 miles per hour
- A terrifying 3 horsepower
