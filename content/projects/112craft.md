### Overview

_Minecraft_ is one of the most popular games of all time,
and one that I have played on and off for at least a decade now.

lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
So, when I needed a term project for my introductory programming class,
I figured I could make my own version of the game.

I then proceeded to spend the semester developing "the greatest term project in 112 history."
It was incredibly overkill, but I had a blast making it and it is still one of my favorite projects to date.

### Features

- Infinite worlds streamed to/from disk
- Procedural generation, including:
	- Caves
	- Ores
	- Biomes
	- Alternate dimensions
- Survival elements, including:
	- Resource gathering
	- Crafting
	- Health
- Switch between OpenGL and pure-Python rendering
- Editable terrain with dynamic lighting
- AI pathfinding
- Networked multiplayer compatible with official Minecraft clients
- Data-driven modeling and animation system
- Translucent textures
- In-world circuit simulation ('redstone')

### Code

The source code for the project is somewhat outdated but can be found
[on my GitHub page here](https://github.com/SuperTails/112craft).

Notably, multiplayer no longer works because Minecraft accounts are now Microsoft accounts.
